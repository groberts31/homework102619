                                <span class="lead">Hello, My name is Gregory Roberts. Born in Barstow, CA and
                                    raised in Charlotte, NC since the age of 3. I am a graduate
                                    of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University.
                                    I majored in Business Finance while also using up my college
                                    free time playing basketball on the Mens School Team. Some of my best qualities
                                    include being able to work in a team capacity, the ability to lead when necessary,
                                    and having a strong work ethic. I have the ability to adapt and I'm very flexible
                                    when it comes to doing what needs to be done to complete tasks.<br><br>

                                    Just to tell you a little bit more about myself, I am a father of 4.
                                    Two boys and two girls. I also have a fiance that has been working
                                    my nerves about this wedding since the day I proposed, making me
                                    rethink this whole marriage thing. Just kidding. I am currently employed with
                                    Wells Fargo Bank as a Financial Crimes Specialist. I have been with the
                                    bank for more than 7 yrs and believe it is now time for a change to
                                    something more interesting and self satisfying which led me to
                                    Computer Coding. I hope to make the best of the opportunity. Thanks for
                                    visiting my page. Feel free to take a look around.</span>
