                    <span class="lead">Hello, My name is Gregory Roberts. Born in Barstow, CA and
                        raised in Charlotte, NC since the age of 3. I am a graduate
                        of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University.
                        I majored in Business Finance while also using up my college
                        free time playing basketball on the Mens School Team.<br><br>

                        Just to tell you a little bit more about myself, I am a father of 4.
                        Two boys and two girls. I also have a fiance that has been working
                        my nerves about this wedding since the day I proposed, making me
                        rethink this whole marriage thing. Just kidding. I am currently employed with
                        Wells Fargo Bank as a Financial Crimes Specialist. I been with the
                        bank for more than 7 yrs and believe it is now time for a change to
                        something more interesting and self satisfying which led me to
                        Computer Coding. I hope to make the best of the opportunity. Thanks for
                        visiting my page. Feel free to take a look around.</span>
