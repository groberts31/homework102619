                <p>Hello, My name is Gregory Roberts. Born in Barstow, CA and
                    raised in Charlotte, NC since the age of 3. I am a graduate
                    of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University.
                    I majored in Business Finance while also using up my college
                    free time playing basketball on the Mens School Team.</p>

                <p>Just to tell you a little bit more about myself, I am a father of 4.
                    Two boys and two girls. I also have a fiance that has been working
                    my nerves about this wedding since the day I proposed, making me
                    rethink this whole marriage thing. Just kidding. I am currently employed with
                    Wells Fargo Bank as a Financial Crimes Specialist. I been with the
                    bank for more than 7 yrs and believe it is now time for a change to
                    something more interesting and self satisfying which led me to
                    Computer Coding. I hope to make the best of the opportunity. Thanks for
                    visiting my page. Feel free to take a look around.</p>
