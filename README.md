# homework102619

****
On this homework I was able to use bootstrap to add a Navigation Bar with the links to my other webpages.

Bootstrap was also used to style the content which includes the main profile picture and also the information about me

Also made the pictures responsive

In the portfolio.html columns and rows were added to keep the pics responsive to the page.

I also added more info in my content for index.html
